# Empty state dataset

This dataset aims at providing an "empty state" for the PIPAS
system. It contains,

* 1 treatment plan, FEC chemotherapy: 6x (Treatment then Rest for 20 days)
* No patient, no treatment
* No cure prescription, no delivery, no appointment yet
* Bed and nurse availabilities (more on wednesdays, nothing on saturdays and sundays)
* No patient unavailability

We suppose that the schedule has been computed at "2014-01-01 12:00:00". No
change has been made since then, so the accuracy timestamp has the same value.
