    "remarks": [
      "The various lists of appointments define the last known solution to the scheduling problem (possibly a previous one). This solution may however be _incomplete_ (e.g. new treatment meanwhile) or even _invalid_ (e.g. new patient unavailability violating a non-fixed appointment)",
      "The `last_scheduled` entry provides the time at which the last known solution was scheduled. The `last_modified` entry provides the time of the last update to a scheduling variable. Provided the Scheduler meets its specification, the last solution is known to be complete and correct if `last_modified <= last_scheduled`. As explained above, it can be incomplete or incorrect otherwise"
